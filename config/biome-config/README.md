## üìÑ Goal

This configuration package has the purpose of store my common configurations used on **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev)**.

### üí°Ô∏è What you will find?

For now, you will found 3 configurations, being two of them based on the main one:
- **`base.json`**: stores the basic/global configuration;
- **`nestjs.json`:** stores the configuration for **NestJS** projects (allowing decorators, etc.);
- **`solidjs.json`:** stores the configuration for **SolidJS** projects, changing a few linter rules (like `noReactSpecificProps`).

## ‚ùì How to install and use it?

To install my package and use it is very simple, you only need to following the steps above.

1. Install the package using your package manager (list of commands above): <br/>
    ![PNPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/PNPM-000?logo=pnpm&logoSize=auto&style=for-the-badge)
    ```bash
      pnpm add -D @tutods/biome-config @biomejs/biome
    ```
    ![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/yarn-000?logo=yarn&logoSize=auto&style=for-the-badge)
    ```bash
      yarn add -D @tutods/biome-config @biomejs/biome
    ```
    ![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-000?logo=npm&logoSize=auto&style=for-the-badge)
    ```bash
      npm install -D @tutods/biome-config @biomejs/biome
    ```

2. Create the configuration file: <br/>
    ![PNPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/PNPM-000?logo=pnpm&logoSize=auto&style=for-the-badge)
    ```bash
      pnpm biome init
    ```
    ![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/yarn-000?logo=yarn&logoSize=auto&style=for-the-badge)
    ```bash
      yarn biome init
    ```
    ![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-000?logo=npm&logoSize=auto&style=for-the-badge)
    ```bash
      npx biome init
    ```

1. On the `biome.json` file (generated on the previous step), remove everything except the `$schema` and `vcs`, adding the line above:
    ```json
      "extends": ["@tutods/biome-config"]
    ```
     - If you want to use the `nestjs` or `solidjs` config you only need to add `/nestjs` or `/solidjs` according to the configuration you want to use.

2. To finish, is missing to setup the scripts on your `package.json`, I usually use the following scripts:
    ```json
      "lint": "biome check .",
      "lint:fix": "biome check --no-errors-on-unmatched --write .",
      "lint:staged": "biome check --no-errors-on-unmatched --staged .",
      "lint:ci": "biome ci --no-errors-on-unmatched .",
    ```
    > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** you can use your own scripts!
